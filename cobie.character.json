    "Wait potentially way more than that because it‚Äôs 10% daily lossback on one half of the volume (rollbit side, not stakeside) but you also can make several bets per day so your volume could even be 5-10x net worth by serially betting anything you could hedge. So 5% on 10x NW daily.",
    "Makes sense to drop insanely large bets in this scenario because you‚Äôre just churning 10% daily on your volume effectively. If you lose this edge (rollbit stopped the program) then obviously you stop betting your net worth daily because it‚Äôs now coinflipping.",

    "If you asked me again today I would obviously say ‚Äúwell the sponsor you thought was reputable might be the fraudster of the century, so maybe it‚Äôs impossible to trust any sponsor‚Äù. We got tons of offers to replace FTX at higher $ cost since, but who fkin knows who‚Äôs solvent now.",

    "maybe we should actually do this",
    "btw followed u so u can dm me any other names u dont wanna share in public",
    "Indeed. Perhaps I thought those things were simply obvious, and the lack of accepting token-founders as guests meant that fraud could not hurt retail so it was fine. But again, didn't predict that Alameda would steal customer deposits so... wrong again.",
    "Even hardcore due dilligence would not have found the 3AC fraud. My understanding is that there was no fraud at all until they took their bad long, and then needed to lie/become fraudulent in order to try and save the fund. So hardcore DD in Jan 2021 would not have helped.",
    "OK fine so, what next? I see it like this: 1) continue the podcast and try to continually remind people we cannot control the actions of our guests 2) stop doing the podcast entirely, leave the content to other people. IMO other people have way worse guest standards than we did.",
    "I think it's an impossible standard to uphold and means hosting the podcast at all is untenable, how tf would we know 3AC is a fraud in January 2021 if the fraud didn't happen until May 2022? We had them on a podcast, people loaned them billions of dollars..!",
    "Fwiw I think the \"powerful voices\" thing is not true, the Sam Trabs Up Only episode has 36,000 views. Plus, hosting a guest is not endorsing a guest or singing their praises. Anyway, in reality, I cannot predict every fraud including future fraud that was not yet underway.",
    "Don't think coinbase should silence him for criticising me, he can say whatever he wants, court of public opinion can decide if he is right. But he also did lie about the Coinbase insider trading stuff which is somewhat problematic for Coinbase",
    "OK I just went through every episode (lol) and the only ones w ppl that since could be described as fraudsters are 3AC and SBF/other Sam Alameda. We had Su 18 months before the fraud, and Kyle a year before. Sam Trabs was mid 2021. Is it expected to predict their fraud then? Idk",
    "I actually think we did a pretty good job at trying to only have guests that didn't have leverage over the audience, or couldn't shill them into any bad investments or whatever. Maybe we shouldn't have had Kwon on afterwards, but it's *much* better than having him on before imo..",
    "We avoided token founders during the peaks of their hype, despite requests. We never even had SBF on solo, the only time he came on was with CZ at the same time. It's pretty impossible to do a crypto podcast if you become responsible for the actions of all your guests afterwards.",
    "Can you give some examples? I feel like the only people we had on the show that turned out to be fraudulent were 3AC and SBF. Su's episode was 18 months before the fraud. We never had Celcius on, we didnt have Do Kwon until *after* the Luna debacle despite the constant requests.",
    "I don't really agree tbh. I doubt people listened to the advert but actively ignored what I actually said and advocated for repeatedly in the podcast. I also don't think blaming people that did nothing wrong makes any sense -- just blame the actual fraudsters.",
    "fwiw, u recognise even the tweet you are sharing is incorrect right? like the fraud was not \"trading against customers and using insight into order book to become rich\" otherwise they would actually have made money instead of losing $10bn.",
    "We didn't even have a ref link. We had a 15 second advert on our 2 hour podcast episodes start/end. We are giving all of the money from these adverts back to the bankruptcy estate and taking nothing personally, even though we are not legally obligated to do that.",

    "These hindsight bias ‚Äúeveryone obviously knew‚Äù tweets are pretty insane to me.",
    "The things I said about Coinbase were verified as actual fraud. The perp has plead guilty. They were on-chain, so it was possible for me (or anyone!) to notice them. FTX‚Äôs fraud was obfuscated away from chain, so I couldn‚Äôt see it. Btw, I said bad things about FTX too!",

    "ha ha get fucked you cant read em now Caroline",
    "Imo this is demonstrably false. I mean, if so, where are all the tweets and videos calling the fraud in advance? Where are your tweets? People lost hundreds of millions on the exch, u think they didn't do 5 min DD?",
    "Obvs considered this but its 6fig out of 11fig hole. Unfortunately cant think of any fair way to do it. IMO better if everybody that can contribute back to the bankruptcy estate does so directly to increase amt for customers.",

    "Maybe we could accept Uniswap as a sponsor -- but what if smart contract risk blows up badly, or if people think it's an endorsement of UNI token..",
    "IMO there needs to be ways to make audience-aligned content as a sustainable business, otherwise all of the content is user-adverse (see: most of crypto youtube). But as an outsider, impossible to tell whether Binance, Bybit, FTX, etc is the \"bad egg\" or if one even exists.",
    "Well, yes, but it's exactly the same for Mercedes, the Miami Heat Arena, etc too. And the audience is also aware that is is a paid advertisement. *And* if it is an \"influencer\" their content can suggest good practices which people know is _not_ an advertisement.",
    "I think he has a point to be fair. It's fairly easy to behave well and build trust but it doesn't stop me doing a massive scam tomorrow.",
    "Well, I mean, nobody could? Think I have seen like 1 person who called it in advance credibly back in June 2022 and he had like no followers.",
    "I don‚Äôt understand if you‚Äôre trying to make some point about these tweets being contradictory. But primary exchange =\\= ‚Äúleave everything on an exchange‚Äù. Just where most of your volume is when you need to make trades.",
    "My brother, it went on for over 20 months before my tweet and after my tweet he was caught within a month. You‚Äôre welcome to believe whoever you want, but the DOJ cited my tweet literally in their ‚Äústart of investigation‚Äù report.",
    "We all know u cheated tho",
    "Thought about it but practically it is just a lottery because it can pay for max like 75 people. And I don‚Äôt think the FTX api is even live anymore.",
    "Yes, Pete was lying about that. That‚Äôs the point. You can even go back to my tweets where Coinbase internal people reply saying ‚Äúthanks, we will take a look‚Äù. I had multiple calls with Brian about it. Brian thanked me at the end of the proceedings.",
    "When we 1st spoke abt sponsorship, the criteria was basically products we actually use and would recommend to friends/family - which means you have like 5 options in crypto. Thought it‚Äôs good signalling if u can run a legit business without shilling scams/token promos. Ironic huh",
    "Fwiw I don‚Äôt think they *should* have to give any money back. They provided a service to a company that they believed was legitimate. I don‚Äôt even think Up Only is legally required to give anything back. But for Ledger and I, we just don‚Äôt want to take a penny from a scam.",
    "Fwiw I used the product myself as primary exchange *and* recommended it to friends/family. We turned down much higher $ because they were less ‚Äúreputable‚Äù brands, or token projects or exchanges w lower volume/more fringe etc.",
    "Yes, I commented on FTX down-only perps, FTX weird tokens (MAPS, OXY) which turned out to be scams, etc. But I also used FTX as my primary exchange and liked the product so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
    "He said I was fudding Coinbase as part of SBF‚Äôs anti-Coinbase agenda. My ‚ÄúCoinbase FUD‚Äù was later revealed to be real, prosecuted by the DOJ, and the people involved plead guilty. Coinbase thanked me for assisting them in finding the bad actors. But Pete likes to pretend.",
    "The expenses paid two part-time employees. Right now we will pay them from our own pocket. We moved all expenses like equipment to our own pocket also. Ledger and I took 0 ourselves. Ledger doing the same for Weekly Open too.",
    "It‚Äôs not much in relation to the 10bn hole. I‚Äôm talking to a lawyer at FTX in this email, recovering 0.000015c on the dollar is low on their priority list, hence ‚Äúnot much‚Äù.",
    "I meant in comparison to the 10bn hole obviously",
    "Btw, Binance actually made an offer to sponsor it too :)",
    "I wasn‚Äôt sponsored personally, Up Only was sponsored, there‚Äôs an advert on every episode, it wasn‚Äôt a secret.",
    "You know, that was actually expected behaviour, but I have no idea why they showed a closeup of that lol. That was obviously theatre tho, Max wanted to show generating the genesis block live, but the 1st block was obviously about a month later at launch to prove no early mining.",
    "I had an argument with that guy in like 2019 about Donald Trump and ever since he has been tweeting about me once per week. Once he even tried to make some story about ‚Äúhow I hate Jews‚Äù or something. He did have the better Donald Trump take at the time though, fair play.",
    "It‚Äôs a good point but I can‚Äôt think of any fair way to do it. There‚Äôs a 10bn hole. If everyone that can contribute back to the estate does so, it‚Äôs best chance of getting most % for most people. Don‚Äôt just wanna run a lottery. Plus hard to even verify who lost what etc.",
    "The difference is tax and the amount we paid 2 part-time employees. Ledger and I take 0 and repay everything. We also transfer any additional costs from the podcast (like equipment etc) to ourselves personally too.",

    "Yeah they paid for ads on my podcast, and we are returning all of the money to the bankruptcy estate so we make 0 from those ads. We didn‚Äôt know it was a scam, obviously. Pete believes that the insider trading I found at Coinbase is part of some FTX conspiracy, though. Idk.",

    "That's pretty common for new/upcoming exchanges as a user growth mechanic, and Binance did it with Aptos recently.",

    "It clearly wasn't obvious, there was a ~10bn bankrun when CZ implied it in the space of like 24 hours and FTX equity investors with access to their actual financial books still lost money. It was maybe obvious that SBF had \"bad vibes\" or that Alameda closeness was problematic.",
    "That was on November 7th 2022, after CZ tweets, and after it started to leak. Sure, I concede some people probably knew this week. But I'm not really talking about this week.",
    "Maybe worthwhile to note that we did not have Do Kwon on BEFORE Luna blew up despite him being the most requested guest for like 3 months from October 2021. Having him on after when the appearance cannot damage anyone further seems fine to me. He was even on Laura Shin 3 wks ago!",

    "My point is, amongst the complaints about Alameda (frontrunning users, \"laggy browser\") etc, nobody said \"Alameda is unprofitable\". They said \"Alameda is only profitable because they have an unfair venue advantage\". Nobody thought FTX had a 10bn hole in the books.",
    "But the FCA warning is not anything to do with the reason FTX blew up. It says they're marketing to UK customers without being regulated in the UK. The same thing Binance did (Binance even had their UK bank accounts halted). Binance has a prop VC firm and internal MM desks.",
    "and IDK if you watched but people just shit on him the entire episode.",

    "Imo FTX Pro app was much better than Binance app, and the FTX wallet UI and general navigation stuff was better. Markets/trading page I am indifferent, I probably like Bitfinex the most there.",
    "Wait, your position is that I am claiming that I think Binance‚Äôs UI is worse than FTX‚Äôs because I am being paid by FTX to damage their competitors in order to boost FTX‚Äôs popularity? While they‚Äôre in bankruptcy and never going to operate again? ‚Ä¶ Instead of it being my opinion?",
    "Prob about 3-4 months ago",
    "FTX equity investors with access to their Q2 books still lost money on the platform. So, I don‚Äôt know how I could know that they are insolvent. It‚Äôs obvious in hindsight but if it were obvious beforehand then there wouldn‚Äôt have been such a shocking bankrun.",
    "Well, I was pretty critical of Celsius, and said they were farming defi with user balances last year. I didn‚Äôt promote Blockfi, haven‚Äôt really ever spoken about them, so idk what you expect me to do there. SBF apparently transferred funds in a way their own auditors couldn‚Äôt see.",
    "sorry her tumblr is called Fake Charity Nerd Girl?",

    "Have you tried Binance?",
    "Wouldn‚Äôt it be ironic if everything is insolvent except Tether",

    "I just chose the same number as the US bank insurance scheme, I dont think 250k is \"poor\" but if everything below that is fully recovered then ppl with like 5k balances are made whole and the whales with 10m balances are not",

    "Sure, you can say \"altcoins with pictures\" are a better than \"altcoins without pictures\". You can say they're or altcoins v2, or an evolution or whatever. But you are still what I said originally, theyre altcoins with pictures! And then everyone got upset about it.",
    "People put their most loved altcoins in their avatars, in their twitter bios, their usernames etc. People also build on their metaverse land when their access/ownership ERC20 and not NFT. I don't think they're that much different nor reductionist at all.",
    "See 2nd tweet Think the point is that it can be a centralising force with lots of delegating to majority stakers for higher APY if the APY did get significantly enough mismatched to solo stakers",
    "And low APY solo stakers may also get diluted when compared to majority stakers if yields misbalance a lot due to MEV (pre PBS etc). And if humans are making economic decisions, they usually try to optimise a little bit. Hence, it could become a centralising force.",
    "You are talking past each other. Of course you don't get diluted vs. total supply if issuance is 0%. You don't even get diluted by not staking if issuance is 0%. But non-stakers get diluted when compared to stakers since their ownership of ETH shrinks relative to stakers.",
    "The discussion started when person said that the future is musicians making their music royalty-free, and instead monetising through web3 (by selling NFTs). I'm just saying that the market for non-speculative stuff is much smaller that altcoin-nfts (I obv acknowledge it exists).",
    "Yes, I'm not saying NFTs are bad or evil or whatever. Jesus christ. I've owned NFTs since 2017 and still buy them sometimes today. I'm just saying that they're similar to altcoins.",
    "Sure, but diversity should have financial value in art, no? If the \"human stuff\" was more important than scarcity/rarity, wouldn't there be less homogeneity in prices across these sets? But instead, there's focus on \"sweeping floor\" and flipping and stuff.",
    "So these 'diverse' things usually bucket into \"floor\", \"mid-tier\" and \"rare\" for their fungible categories. Of course it's still somewhat different, but I think it's still very similar to an altcoin and behaves/trades like one too. And, the NFT market is dominated by these things",
    "Yes, there is trait diversity, but often it doesn't materially impact much unless there is a scarcity-enforced \"rarity\" system. See, a lot of variation in traits, but a fungible CLOB-style orderbook floor price:",
    "Why you trying to fire Brian man what did he ever do to you",
    "I agree with you, which is why I think most NFTs are currently like altcoins! Altcoins space runs on attention and hype..",
    "I think instead of getting annoyed about it, you can ask, what is the difference between an altcoin like Doge (culturally important, has human stuff too) and errr... Moonbirds, or Crypto Dickbutts? Whats the difference between Otherside Land and metaverse token like SAND?",
    "There is obviously some art-like segments of the NFT market but they are much smaller segments vs. the majority of volume. IMO probably higher % of \"art\" on Tezos vs Ethereum too. On ETH there's much more altcoin-like speculation in % volume terms.",
    "But my point is that most of the successful NFT projects are very limited on \"human stuff\", lean into fungibility so they can trade altcoin-like, and ppl speculate on them to make more money with a short time horizon which feels different to art for me.",
    "IMO altcoins are not money and *most* NFTs are not art, particularly the very successful NFTs with high fungibility. So I didn't compare art to money. I compared tokens to tokens The only NFTs I think are art-like are 1/1s and low supply series of stuff, plus stuff like Fidenzas",

    "yeah but with tokens",
    "undress to earn seems like it would have a market tho",
    "this is the first time ive seen anyone mention it lol",
    "Yes, I read that tweet as to say \"imagine someone being interested in 5% real yield as a solo staker when you can get 25% real yield by doing something easier\" I think it's a fair point, misbalanced yields could be a centralising force for staking",
    "I'm focusing on that because that is what the conversation topic was stated to be very early in the conversation :)",
    "His point is not that you get diluted *in real terms* (eg. yield 5% and issuance 6%) His point is that minority stakers are diluted compared to majority stakers (eg. your neighbour earns 2-5x your yield) He said it quite early on..",
    "I think that it does. If the majority of stakers are earning on average 100% apy and you‚Äôre earning 5% apy, you are eroding your % share of the Ethereum network vs average market participants.",
    "Why doesn‚Äôt it matter? What matters is whether your % share of the Ethereum network is reducing vs average market participants. If everyone stakes then lowest APY stakers actually = 0% effectively.",
    "Anyway you answered your own q I start the year with 100 ETH, so does Alice, so does Bob I stake 100% APY, Alice 5% and Bob 0% At the end of the year: Me 200 ETH Alice 105 ETH Bob 100 ETH You don‚Äôt think Alice feels like she is getting eroded vs the majority of staking mkt?",
    "Okay now imagine that the default / rational behaviour is to be staking (you know like is the case for some alt L1s with ~80% staked) If everyone is staking and the majority are in bigger pools with higher apy then you‚Äôre losing market share by being a solo staker",
    "Err that‚Äôs not really his point tho If biggest pool has eg 10% apy and solo stakers have 5% apy and non stakers have 0% apy Then over time solo stakers still get eroded out vs those staking in bigger pools",
    "What is Coinbase, like, 25% of the mkt? If everyone unstaked from that at once, isn‚Äôt it like 4 months of queue? So there is kinda a difference, even tho the same pressure can be put on mining pools as it can validators",

    "IMO your tweet is why music NFTs are not desirable to artists (whose main business requires people to go to their shows in real life). \"Coldplay are grifters, I speculated on this and now it's down a lot, fuck that stupid band!\"",
    "Eh, if you don't make any money they don't ask you for their money back, that's an investment. That's why I said 'kind-of' investment.",
    "It's not far off. ¬£45 is $55. But as a fan, you might have to pay way more. Because these things get bought out very quickly by financial speculators to be resold No benefit for the artist, and simply a worse experience for real fans/consumers Want more of that in music? NFTs!",
    "Well they pay a lump sum of money in advance of a record, it's a kind-of investment. Artists need the lump sum to come from somewhere.",
    "So, what, creatives should turn their work into an advert for a speculative altcoin investments? And they should encourage their fans to buy and trade this shit? Doesn't make sense to me really, and don't even think it's clear that having fans as investors is even a good thing.",
    "acknowledge that the NFT volume is &gt;95% in speculative almost-fungible stuff that trades similar to altcoins. In fact, they're like altcoins v2, a slightly better version of altcoins. The market for 1/1 and less speculative \"collecting\" is much, much smaller.",
    "The conversation started from my discussion with Spencer and Coop, then Deeze posted this during that, so I'm still having the same conversation. Am arguing that ppl claiming hand-wavy \"monetising via web3\" or \"sell NFTs\" as an alternative to eg. signing to a record label don't",
    "My point is simply: non-speculative \"collecting\" (ie. not shitcoining or gambling) is a significantly smaller market. The music NFT proponents suggest 'selling tokens and using your music as an advertisement for those tokens' but this only works in speculo-fungible type mania IMO",
    "i know theres other platforms, and the beeples arent counted here too, but it paints a very different picture than opensea which was doing billions in monthly volume with &gt;95% on almost-fungible-like stuff",
    "thx, theyre a bit off but pmuch the same in magnitude. the 2nd query you shared is kinda my point. $3m is still a lot for an individual artist (and much better than trad-art) but not in the grand scheme of the NFT bubble. top10 artists only did $100m in combined lifetime sales.",
    "IMO it's just saying \"give the speculation opportunity and financial risk onto fans instead of record labels\" which imo is worse for the band in the longrun bc 1) retail investors are annoying and entitled and 2) record labels actually do some stuff as part of the relationship",
    "NFT pfp sets at \"floor\" are effectively fungible, that is why sudoswap and nftx and etc are popular, and \"floor sweeping\" is a thing. At the higher end/rare theyre much less fungible.",
    "I mean, 1/1 mktplaces do p low volume. Maybe a lot of it is captured by Opensea now or something? It doesn't seem to me that the demand for non-speculative NFT stuff is close to being able to support large musicians in replacement of royalties as claimed",
    "Ok cool, what are some of those ways you can imagine?",
    "Yes a concert ticket is access to real-life entertainment. You get to see the artist you love! Merch is clothing, it means you are not naked and you signal your interests to other not naked people. Perhaps you can argue for a metaverse style merch as additional revenue.",
    "i dont think thats true. theres many examples of coins being social tokens -- doge was an elon social token for a while, even a lot of defi projects are social tokens.",
    "I mean sure you can do it, but doesn't this just require a transfer of the early financial risk from the record label to the fans? Record labels kind of \"invest\" in artists, so fans would have to replace that early funding $ to get the share instead of a label..?",
    "okay so instead of selling to the record label we sell to our 135 fans but instead of selling the rights to the songs, we keep those and we just sell them a token",
    "Or maybe you are confining what altcoins are to the present and not to their potential future value ;-)",
    "Watching ForNFT draw incorrect conclusions from tweets shows the power and weakness of oversimplification.",
    "I think that there are some people (almost all of which are experiencing wealth effect from their crypto success) that transition into \"collecting\" as a form of longer-term investing. I think if you get rich on this stuff it's easy to see it as \"more\" than altcoins w pictures.",
    "I think my point is that at least 90% of the NFT volume is also people doing that. The collector niche with less speculation is a significantly smaller market and maybe even driven by the wealth effect of people that were already successful at the speculation stuff.",
    "Sure, I like em. I like altcoins and they're better than altcoins because they've got nice pictures attached.",
    "You‚Äôd think that in the great web3 bubble there would be some way to ‚Äúmonetise in web3‚Äù if it‚Äôs going to be the standard in the future. But sure. Forget today. How do you foresee it will happen in the future? What does the world look like in 5-10 years for musical artists?",
    "Brother, you started by saying it‚Äôs def the future and I said ‚Äúhow‚Äù and you said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù Forgive me for being fooled by the idea that you didn‚Äôt have structured thoughts on the idea",

    "Yeah I tried to buy the whole thing after the guy was revealed to be a serial rugger or something. But they said no, it‚Äôs not for sale.",
    "Which I think is extremely far from the truth, because the majority of NFT volume is speculation on almost-fungible collections. Famous musicians should obviously not be swapping out music royalties for speculation-driven revenue; if it‚Äôs non-speculative then mkt size is smaller.",
    "I‚Äôm not saying I dislike NFTs at all. I‚Äôm saying that the market for non-speculative non-‚Äúshitcoin‚Äù NFTs is less than 1% of the market for altcoins with pictures. The conversation started because someone claimed artists could ‚Äúsell NFTs‚Äù instead of getting music royalties.",
    "Or just says ‚Äúwhat about selling a token?‚Äù as the solution to all problems whether they‚Äôre real problems or not.",
    "Why do you need to speculate on meet-and-greet tickets? It doesn‚Äôt help the artist and makes prices worse for real fans. If it‚Äôs a legitimate ticket transfer, that‚Äôs already solved with most major ticket retailers.",
    "Do you think those smaller markets sustain if there was not the huge bubble of the generative animal clones?",

    "No shade to you at all, for an artist it is a great income. But this conversation started bc \"selling NFTs\" was presented as an alternative to music royalties. My point is simply that without the speculation encouraged by fungibility, the market for NFTs is significantly smaller.",
    "I don't see how 2) is materially more attractive with an ERC20 or an NFT vs. a PDF sent in an email address that lets you in. The attractive part is the meet and greet.",
    "thats because 90% of NFT volume is type 2",
    "because the conversation started as a suggestion to use NFT sales to replace existing business lines (such as music royalties). my argument is that there is no demand for that without extreme amts of speculation encouraged.",
    "sorry, why do you need to speculate on tokens for that to happen?",
    "but am arguing that just telling every single creative in the world to make the actual work people want free (music, film, etc) and instead tell them \"just sell some tokens, you'll get a closer relationship with your fans\" is the worst idea ive ever heard",
    "i am not even arguing anti-nft btw. i think nfts as collectibles are fine/cool as long as you acknowledge theyre similar to altcoins with pictures. (maybe altcoins even needed pictures to have a longer lifespan!)",
    "imagine this but wait every single coin has a different picture",
    "yo those mummy things ripped tho",
    "The royalties argument is actually a good split -- shows who is making an altcoin and making actual NFTs. Sudoswap / pool products work well for very fungible collections, cos theyre basically altcoins. Dont work well for 1/1s though, so theyll prob keep royalties much longer",
    "Yeah but shitcoiners sold their shitcoins for over a billion dollars, so doubt they care much about the royalties, which will be gone soon anyway",
    "yeah, why do you think there's no 24/7 tradeable mkt for country club memberships btw?",
    "i think NFTs are fine, they are fun. i think larping about \"monetisation via web3 and nfts\" without any sort of structured thinking as to how is cringe",
    "Like, maybe. But then why does everyone keep selling their country clubs membership and talking about \"floor price\" :)",
    "Nooooo cobie u have to like our nfts theyre not just speculative tokens bro, well yes people do buy and sell them to try and get more ETH, but its different trust me bro, btw music nfts will kill spotify cobie noooo",
    "Soz, Forgot Pak, who also makes very fungible sets too. Because fungible sets are better NFTs. Because NFTs are altcoins with pictures.",
    "Perhaps xcopy and beeple, but both have leaned into fungibility a lot (selling prints or collection sets). The last two dont seem to be very high $ at all unless there are additional sale venues that they dont list in their profiles.",
    "In 2013 the highest priced coin on Cryptsy sold for over 300 BTC. It was called \"42 coin\" and there were only 42 of them.",
    "Can you point me to 5 artists that have created respectable $ businesses w 1/1s that have consistently performed well over, say, 12 months?",
    "If you believe otherwise, then you must answer: why are the successful NFTs all extremely fungible? 1/1s and actual artists works do horribly because for a shitcoin to be successful it requires high enough velocity which is achieved by being almost fungible.",
    "It‚Äôs extremely simple. They are altcoins with pictures. Anything suggesting otherwise is larp and cope.",
    "Yeah their fans are willing to pay for less stuff and somehow you think they‚Äôre gonna proritise buying a rare Ed Sheeran token for thirty grand instead of going to the live show for $50.",

    "BUT not clear at all to me that having your initial fans as investors is a good thing. Only works well on the extremely happy path. Can kill bands fanbases on any non-perfect path",

    "Long term demand of what? The start of the thread established that their music should be free and they should ‚Äúmonetise in web3‚Äù.",
    "Btw they could do that without ‚Äúweb3‚Äù by just selling equity in the band and then going public later. This thread is about how does web3 monetisation actually happen for the band. Your answer is just ‚Äúsell tokens and charge rent on secondary sales‚Äù.",
    "Lmao you guys are actually serious",
    "No, that‚Äôs deriving entertainment from financial speculation. It‚Äôs not adding financial speculation to existing entertainment that they already enjoy.",
    "I didn‚Äôt say anywhere that they won‚Äôt pay for virtual stuff. I asked why they‚Äôll suddenly pay more if tokens are involved.",
    "I don‚Äôt see how that helps monetisation, it just changes the buyer. Plus, there‚Äôs plenty of reasons why I‚Äôd rather have the equity firm owner. Fans are retail investors and you lose fans if they lose a lot of money. Reselling fan club memberships just reduces artist revenue..?",
    "If the master/publishing markets are public how does this help the band monetise? They already sell it early and usually get pretty good deals. What does liquid market? Tokenised fan clubs seem to reduce revenue to the artist because membership can be resold, less primary sales.",
    "Why don‚Äôt virtual ‚Äúfandoms‚Äù create large revenue streams now? Why will they suddenly be viable with ERC20 tokens?",
    "Because they grant you access to the live musical performance of the band you love?? You get to experience the music of someone you like?",
    "I actually think ur tweet is directionally the opposite of the future. Think it‚Äôs extremely unlikely that people will mix financial speculation and investment (the only way web3 monetisation would make sense) into their entertainment choices. What a great way to ruin a good song.",
    "Markets already exist for master/publishing rights, they are just private markets. Why would a tokenised fan club perform better than a regular non-token gated but paywalled fan club? Everything you just said is ‚Äúsell some tokens‚Äù but not really clear why anyone would buy them.",

    "I 100% agree with both ur tweets.",
    "To summarise ur point is tokens are inherently scammier due to 1) lack of clear legal recourse, 2) no established case law and 3) unclear non-specific language about the exact structure of the investment that someone is making?",

    "Half of your tribe spends all of their time appealing to SEC enforcement. If your complaint is the word ‚Äúequity-like‚Äù is misleading then fine u can tell me whichever word u like to best suit tokens that represent ownership of a protocol without established caselaw/legal recourse.",

    "We will see where the US lands on whether ether is a security, or whether it isn‚Äôt due to the many-party-value argument / Bahamas test. It probably isn‚Äôt a security anymore despite being ‚Äúprotocol equity‚Äù or a crypto-equity or whatever imo, but it *could* still be one.",
    "Eg. Owning ether is obviously owning protocol equity in Ethereum ‚Äî ether isn‚Äôt money imo. Owning CRV or GMX is protocol equity in their respective projects too. If your point is that equity is a security in the USA so I shouldn‚Äôt say that, meh.",
    "You don‚Äôt need to own them. Delegation is a representative electoral model.",
    "Why not? Most things are obviously equity-like or a new kind of ‚Äúprotocol equity‚Äù. Ignoring this and trying to obfuscate it has caused 1) worse token models for good actors and 2) general confusion allowing bad actors to ‚Äúblend in‚Äù.",
    "I think I agree basically with everything u just said, yeah, except also believe that the SEC is unnecessarily parental and not a fan of excessive regulation. In a world where SEC is effective and more light-touch, sure.",
    "I mean, these protocols issue revenue directly to token holders, have no ‚Äúreal equity‚Äù alternative for owners, and yes of course you own them. It‚Äôs only a handful of these projects, and most others are nothing, but idk that ignoring projects trying to do it properly helps",
    "Some tokens are proxy equity now. In many token projects no equity actually even exists ‚Äî the only way to own the project is the token. It‚Äôs a small number of projects operating this way but the good actors that do it this way are imo superior to priv equity ownership model.",
    "Bro did u just copy paste this",
    "If ether is not \"virtually equity\" in Ethereum, what is a better equity in Ethereum? How do you bet on Ethereum if not via ether? Maybe \"staked ether\" is virtually equity, and ether is not, perhaps.",
    "I mean that‚Äôs actually a good original assumption, but it‚Äôs not true for all tokens anymore. There‚Äôs several that are not scams. It‚Äôs possible to launch non-scam tokens. But yes there‚Äôs a very high % penetration of scams.",
    "Most of these people take zero responsibility for choices that they made ‚Äî they chose to copy you! If they lose, it‚Äôs your fault. Man what if they win, do I get a cut of the winnings? Nah I get fuck all",
    "I don‚Äôt mind ppl copying honestly ‚Äî have done it myself many times ‚Äî but really hate it when they‚Äôre not self aware enough to take responsibility for what they‚Äôre doing. If I‚Äôm blindly copying other ppl in a probabilistic outcomes business I at least recognise my own risk choices",
    "Yeah don‚Äôt want any CT bellends spoiling that",
    "Imo btc community should be supporting honest actors issuing tokens for legitimate products that are not deceptively marketed. If stacks is actually doing something bad then fair enough but seems insane to call it a scam from what I currently know about it.",
    "Debatable, but aside from that, my original point that started this entire thread was that tokens are not a scam and in fact likely required to build these systems ‚Äî and the btc community call every single btc-based system with a token a scam. So how do we ever get off Ethereum?",
    "Was it the Arbitrum seller?",
    "Well who knows why Max shilled it but I‚Äôd be exceptionally surprised if he made any money on it. I think he did it more for clout. To my knowledge, he didn‚Äôt have any mining setup back then, but it‚Äôs possible he did have in secret. But he didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúinsider‚Äù coins, so, yeah",
    "Am sure this will go well and not cause any problems",
    "Not entirely clear that that‚Äôs true to me ‚Äî eg Ether is obviously ‚Äúprotocol equity‚Äù in the Ethereum chain but since it‚Äôs value does not rely solely on one party it‚Äôs unlikely a security today.",
    "I don‚Äôt think us nor Max tried to scam anyone ‚Äî it was obv a huge failure though (except shipping Schnorr siga before BTC adopted them which is a minor victory). It had fair launch with zero premine, zero funding, zero dev tokens, etc. Maybe Max went overboard on shilling it.",
    "i dont know that it is their job -- if so, lots of stuff would be banned, like casinos where by design everyone loses except the business. if sophisticated actors can profitably invest, retail investors shouldnt be banned from it. governments instead should improve education :)",
    "i mean if its a drug you cant reproduce the same experience. if its a video game you likely can",
    "btw i think 20 are like not scams and also viable. i think theres probably 100s that are not scams but just stupid ideas, not viable, poorly designed etc. then there's 1m scams of course also.",
    "idk if it's a benefit to society or not. it was a benefit to my life. am sure people that lost money overall would say its not a benefit to society. but it's freedom! controlling who is allowed to invest is much worse, governments can dictate who is allowed to get rich.",
    "Agree, though I think Uni token is a case where it would look a lot different and more equity-like if the SEC were not a force in their lives.",
    "I think Uni's argument is prob something like they sold equity (a security) and investors also receive a token (not a security) in one of their products. Think there's a sub 0.00001% chance Uniswap Labs tries to go public, but can imagine them launching other tokenised products.",
    "Eh, of course Curve, Uniswap, Aave etc inherit some censor-resistance and decentralisation from Ethereum. Even Tornado Cash, which is now sanctioned, is still trivially useable in the US.",
    "I dont even know what shitcoin means anymore. Isn't L-BTC just like wBTC but probably more trustless somehow (whereas wBTC is just Bitgo custodianship with kyc)?",
    "but if it was a recreational chemical psychedelic trip without reproducibility that would suck",
    "nice, i get to play it again",
    "Obv there are arguments around whether Ethereum is censor-resistant enough to actually fulfil this censor-resistant stock market pipedream. But it's the best we have for now -- and if btc community keeps attacking the btc-native attempts as \"scams\" it will probs stay that way.",
    "I think that self-custodying my assets is better than relying on a broker/custodian. AMMs are useful. I think 24/7 markets with unified liquidity are good. I don't have to give KYC info to a DEX. To me it is like saying \"does bitcoin need a blockchain?\". Yes. It's my property.",
    "Yes the 1% would be more straightforward which gives the scams less ability to \"blend in\" and look similar. Plus, it might open the door for more legit things if straightforward was possible.",
    "... it's either a grey area or simply illegal (depending on the type of token), there is an extremely high penetration of people that don't care about the law or are risk-tolerant enough as the token issuers, and all the equities (which would be better as tokens) won't do it.",
    "I guess the way I see it is that the benefits for scammers of tokens (superior liquidity, decentralized method of exchange, self-custody, censor-resistance) are actually benefits for everybody -- all those attributes would also be superior for \"normal\" investing too. BUT bc ...",
    "From the little I know of Stacks, they seem like not bad actors to me. I don't think a premine of protocol equity is bad thing for Stacks: it is not trying to be \"money\", and founders having some value capture is fine. Unlikely it outperforms BTC but surely \"scam\" is incorrect.",
    "But I think if the SEC rules didn't exist, a lot of these tokens would provide much clearer ownership rights too. Right now, nobody wants a fine or an investigation, so they live in the stupid greyzones of utility or whatever. Think they'd be more straightfw if it was possible.",
    "And most people are fucking stupid, so I know there's a lot of strong answers for \"yes\". And then there's the misinformation, scams, deception, false marketing, etc making the \"yes\" case even stronger. But fraud is still illegal even without accreddited investor laws :)",
    "The Ethereum ICO was almost certainly an illegal securities sale at the time it happened. But the people that invested in it unilaterally made money in both BTC and USD terms. Should the SEC have the right to prevent that opportunity? Should people have been restricted from that?",
    "Basically -- should the SEC have the right to decide what retail investors are or are not allowed to invest in? I can see why people would answer \"yes\", but personally I believe in personal freedom and people should have the right to do what they want with their own money.",
    "If you ignore for a moment all the scams or grey-area tokens, and focus on the non-scam good actor tokens (there's probably like 20 of them in total lol) then the only real point that I think has contention is \"should normal people/retail be allowed to risk their money on them?\"",
    "In the case of Stacks or Curve, token-based, identity-free, decentralized protocol ownership is likely a good anti-censorship tool. If Curve just used equity, Curve the company could be heavily pressured to act in certain ways (see: Circle, Infura).",
    "I obv agree that if you were a scammer, using tokens is much better than using equity. Equity has ez regs, inefficient market, no early liquidity and uses base money that can be censored/seized. But I think for good actor defi, using tokens is much better than using equity too.",
    "Yes, Celcius was a scam and their business model did not need a token at all. It's easy to point out many bad examples like this bc there's lots. But Curve is not a scam and actually having a token is likely better ownership model for Curve than private company equity would be.",
    "Gonna try and address this bit by bit, bc you make some good points, but none are inherently anti-token IMO. In your second tweet, you mention tokens are often used for scams. I totally agree. There has been reg-arb and froth. But many tokens are effectively \"protocol equity\".",
    "Eh... there's lots of tokens that don't pretend to be utility or \"require themselves as access to purchase\".",
    "who is the protagonist",
    "My man. You call yourself a ‚Äúdegen ape‚Äù. Look in the mirror.",
    "u gonna wear a mask bro?????",
    "So, as long as Stacks was not doing scammy marketing, lying to people, fake hype, etc -- is a token inherently worse? In some ways it seems better to me -- but only if the token issuer effectively issues it as \"protocol equity\", not some weird circular pointless token.",
    "I guess what I am saying is, you are highlighting abuse that bad actors have done with tokens -- and yes, there has been a lot of it. But IMO it's not instantly obvious that it means it is impossible for a good actor to issue a token without these issues.",
    "\"Premining\" is also true for equity though, so doesn't seem like a token issue. Agree tokens are not as well defined as equity which leaves room for scams, but don't think a well-defined token is by default a scam, esp when it is modelled virtually as equity-but-on-a-chain.",

    "well if seed investors are losing at 20m then the retail buyers are losing by over half since theyre buying at 50m. agree its a decent project and decent team, just interested in the claim that gifting 60 friends &amp; family angels free money is somehow fairer for retail",

    "But seed only loses if retail loses by over half. It's \"fairer for retail\" if they lose at the same rate. Seed gets larger size in exchange for illiquidity risk. Not to mention, seed can participate in public too.",
    "hell u could even do 7m at 70m to three vcs and then sell a 5-10m public token round at 50m better for retail (and same price), VCs likely dont care bc they need to buy size anyway, and u end up with more funding than u have currently",
    "if you do 7m at 70m (seed) and then 15m at 70m (public) think you end up \"fairer for retail\" than selling cheaper to friends and family but it is just my opinion",
    "so its not really \"public dumping on seed\" because they have to sell at 50% loss or more even to get seed to break-even..?",
    "nobody wanted it back in 2020. both paradigm and a16z even said no. my old boss said no :)",
    "bc if it's higher (eg. 40m) then it's not really \"public dumping on seed\" because they'd have to sell at 50% loss just to dump seed to break-even",
    "at the same price? 20m fdv?",
    "what is \"the 50% discount\"?",
    "also, you can price the public sale whatever you want, there is no reason it can't be below the private sale even :)",
    "only if the public sale is sufficient %-wise, otherwise you just give a lottery ticket to the retail that can get in (or you pro-rata it down to tiny numbers) and the rest of retail pile into a low float. see: every ido of the last 2 years.",
    "so... u end up in a scenario where private buyers are in profit even if retail lose. whereas if priv buyers pay higher, much more likely they would have to take a loss to dump on retail.",
    "imo it's better for it to be possible for retail to buy at valuations close to the private/VC valuations. if you do round at 70m, maybe retail can buy similar price terms to VCs. but likely they cant if you're at 20m.",
    "why is selling 10% at a much much cheaper valuation better for retail than selling 13% at the higher valuation? sure the distribution is better being held by 60 ppl vs 3 entities but at the same time 60 ppl paying only 50k means they dont have much skin in the game/much to lose",

    "i just dont think it matters whether its transparent or not if your argument is \"retail wont think about it, they cant do analysis\" UST was open source and on chain and it didnt matter",

    "Perhaps. But even with these examples, we all knew. 0xb1 was farming defi with celcius funds, it was hardly a secret, and that was in like january 2021 lol. Celcius deposits -&gt; defi farming is all on-chain, didnt need employee whistleblowing for that.",

    "Eh... UST got to a 40bn market cap...",
    "IMO enemy here is schemes offering yield w/o sharing or explaining the risks and mechanisms to customers. CeFi (Celcius, etc) did that and DeFi (UST, etc) did that. In both cases depositors get fucked. Is the solution to be more CeFi or DeFi? No, is to build sustainable products.",
    "And if the CeFi companies had done over-collateralised lending as some DeFi protocols do, then those lenders would probably be okay today too. But of course, that business model is not as attractive, cos over-collateralised loans are niche and dont pay such high yields...",
    "If a theoretical DeFi protocol had also done uncollateralized lending w the same credit assessment boundaries as most of these CeFi lenders appear to have then those DeFi protocols will also create bad debt very quickly -- probably even more quickly!",
    "So I don't know how much \"CeFi\" vs \"DeFi\" is a useful framing really. Think the main issue is a massive lack of thinking, risk management and flooding of greed and exuberance. Would love ppl to build more sound and sustainable businesses, whether theyre CeFi or DeFi.",
    "What's clear to me is that the majority (or all?) CeFi crypto lenders were using unsustainable business models -- either leveraging unsound schemes, or lending to people that were. Whereas some DeFi protocols are not, and they still operate business as usual.",
    "Of course there was a lot of unsustainable yield products (eg. UST and many many many more). But there's also a lot of \"defi\" that is not an unsustainable yield product -- eg. Aave does not offer unsustainable yield and unsurprisingly none of these CeFi lenders were using Aave.",
    "It's not clear that they all were, tho. Sure, for Celcius they were offering unsustainable yield and going far-down the risk tail to try and make that yield for customers. But for some, they're just loaning to people uncollateralised who then lost the money going long at 30k.",
    "you do realize the entire western world already has a credit system for lending too? how do you think they evaluate if you can take a loan, or get a mortgage..?",
    "yes, that is what my original tweet says",
    "cefi lenders created bad debt and now require bailouts to make retail depositors whole and allow them to withdraw funds seems more important than valuations aave is down 20-30% relative to ~actual facebook~ since the beginning of the year lol",
    "yes aave rates are garbage but thats expected imo. undercollateralized loans need a credit system",
    "and when u take a loan from celcius or voyager or coinflex they just check if ur famous on twitter lol",
    "in a centralized/decentralized way wen u take a loan from the bank to buy a motorbike, they do an assessment on if youll be able to pay back based on like ur income, ur spending, ur previous debts, etc. when u take a loan from defi they dont need to cos u post margin",
    "and if defi did non-collateralised or under-collateralised lending then they would be rekt too, probably at lightning speed business practice losses from uncollateralised lending shouldnt be equated to smart contract exploits imo, the biz models are different, both can be done",
    "when u fuck up the trade then the cefi lender is rekt, because they trusted u to pay back and u didnt. defi doesnt require trust bc the borrower posts more margin so they just take it if u dont pay back. if celcius did over-collateralised lending then it would prob be fine too",

    "Hahahahahhahahahahahahahah wow this one won‚Äôt be beaten",
    "‚ÄúFoooo why did you sell your honorary NFT???‚Äù",
    "NFT honoraries are given to you because you have a lot of followers, the creator wants to raise their profile, almost exclusively for business reasons And their NFT community says ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sell it though!! you have to keep it in ur wallet promote us!‚Äù Worst birthday gift ever",
    "Birthday gifts come from people that you love. Their intended purpose is to make you happy by buying you something that they think you will like. Often these people say ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it, you can replace it with something you like‚Äù.",
    "One guy tweeted to me that it‚Äôs like selling your birthday gifts cos I said it‚Äôs rational to sell them lol",
    "Yeah that‚Äôs fine if they want to do that. They‚Äôve been given something, they own it, they can do what they want with it. But that‚Äôs not what I do nor what I was describing.",
    "This is a good question",
    "An act not too dissimilar from buying honoraries.",
    "I have now wiped and am leaving the toilet and twitter app thank you for reading.",
    "Of course it is. Someone buys an honorary from you, and you use those proceeds to buy NFTs from the collection.",
    "But if you‚Äôre able to predict that, you may as well invest in whatever they become famous for or become their manager or something. Rather than buying their personally branded Giraffe in Opensea.",
    "Final tweets because I am almost finished with my time on the toilet: if you buy an honorary NFT of someone that goes on to later become super famous for something very good, in an NFT set that‚Äôs successful while they‚Äôre famous, then you probably 1000x the mean set return.",
    "And this way at least the honoraries don‚Äôt become extractive ‚Äî money from honoraries goes back into the NFT collection until great success is achieved, or I baghold them forever. But at least I chose them, rather than my wallet being 104739200 Kurt Cobain hybrid animals.",
    "And as an honorary receiver that does not care at all about the sentimental value of a Kurt Cobain-looking NFT, I much prefer to buy things I like from the set and sell the thing I don‚Äôt want to someone that wants it, for whatever unfortunate reasons they‚Äôve decided to want it.",
    "The only reasons to buy honorary (or hold) are non-financial: sentimental reasons and shit. And maybe if you‚Äôre a superfan of the honorary person, which means you have extreme problems already, and which NFT you are buying is not high enough on your list of issues to address rn.",
    "A good way to think about this is to invert it: let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt have any NFT and you‚Äôre going to buy one ‚Äî under what circumstances do you choose to buy an honorary over one from the core set? Never, right? So, it‚Äôs very rational to sell them if you own them.",
    "Big compliment. Thank you",
    "Also when you get cancelled your honorary goes to zero instantly, but the ones you buy only go to zero when the whole set goes to zero. Freedom.",
    "Selling honoraries to buy main set is always superior. Buying something you like rather than a Kurt Cobain promo version is much better, honoraries often don‚Äôt even get main-set benefits. Selling honorary bayc &amp; buying multiple bayc with proceeds was 10x on holding honorary.",

    "Deflationary is wrt supply, not the circulating supply, no?",
    "It would create a discount, but not a premium.",
    "There isnt really a discount on stETH now..?",
    "Well, maybe by your own personal preference. But if you evaluate by some proxy of popularity, eg. follower count, you have them exactly backwards.",
    "Yes, obviously, you are agreeing with me. Arthur and Hunter are arguing the opposite.",
    "Since there may be people paying a premium for ‚Äúinstant staking‚Äù.",
    "Yes but if there was a massive validator queue due to staking gold rush, people might mint stETH to bypass the queue, massively diluting the rewards, and requiring a stETH rewards queue to be implemented in response. Yield would go back up, and stETH may trade above ETH.",
    "But why? Who would be paying a premium to buy the stETH, when they could get it cheaper by buying ETH and instantly minting stETH for free? It's like saying wrapped ETH might have a premium on ETH \"because other eth is unwilling to wrap\".",
    "... I mean that's really not the point is it? Every ETH has the same rights as stETH since it can be instantly turned into stETH, so why does a premium exist on stETH? ETH supply has nothing to do with it...",
    "There are infinite rights to future yield, that can be instantly minted, why does the future rights exist on stETH and not ETH?",
    "Must always speak my truth",
    "So stETH should never trade at a sustained premium to ETH as long as you can instantly mint stETH. Most wrapped staked ether is more likely to trade at a discount due to lack of native unstaking currently on eth - such discount negated by existence of liquid stetheth pool.",
    "If stETH &gt; ETH then rational actors will mint stETH and sell to ETH for free arb. If they can‚Äôt quickly mint stETH due to a queue then the arb would close and buying stETH might be attractive, causing sustained premium. But that is theoretical and no signs of needing that.",
    "The only way stETH should have a sustained premium to ETH is if the validator queue got sufficiently long that instant minting stETH created an unattractive dilution, thus causing the implementation of a stETH queue to match validator queue.",
    "One thing I didn‚Äôt understand in Arthur‚Äôs post is that he suggests stETH should have a premium to ETH because of future yield. Either he doesn‚Äôt recognise that it‚Äôs a rebase token, or he doesn‚Äôt realise you can instantly mint 1 stETH with 1 ETH.",
    "The price is still lower than my tweetstorm, so they saved money if they sold. It went down 70% afterwards. Bagholding it to breakeven to compound 6% doesn‚Äôt seem worth it when you could just‚Ä¶ buy 70% lower",

    "Women founding startups might be a good proxy for risk, and is still higher than in crypto. Not sure that \"prefer tradfi\" is a very good theory, why would there be a gender-derived preference for a type of banking?",
    "2-in-10 ends up closer to the ratio of startups founded by women, which might be a good proxy for how people evaluate risk.",
    "Yeah so maybe you can suggest women are more mission-driven and making $ for the sake of $ is not interesting. But crypto does have a higher purpose than $, and the gender balance in SWE or finance is better than crypto.",

    "The gender distribution is significantly less balanced than comparable industries, SWE or tradfi, which suggests there is dissuasion from entering the space from people that are skilled to do so.",
    "Yes, it's extremely good that identity politics is often rejected and pseudonyms are well accepted. But think crypto is behind both SWE and tradfi inclusion for now. Which seems counterintuitive in a level-playing field industry that allows idea/merit above identity.",
    "Even then, you'd expect it to be more similar to software engineering or finance (think both is ~30%). Whereas currently it's more similar to fund mgmt or something. If crypto is 'the future' and not niche asset management, you'd also expect ratio to trend towards more women.",
    "Maybe we can't do anything about it and that's fine. But proper global talent-maximisation imo does not result in such an imbalance.",
    "Yes, not really a very complex idea. If you want the best talent globally to contribute, then it is likely more than 1 in 10 will be women. And if the ratio is as low as 1 in 10 currently, then it's likely there is some reason worth understanding.",
    "I mean, they are choosing not to -- but why? Whatever reason can be considered a barrier. Even if it's not actually a barrier.",
    "Even if Algod is a woman (he isn't, I've spoken to him on Discord a lot), assuming that he is male wouldn't change observation that the space is 90% male.",
    "If you measured relevant talent across the globe, it will likely not be 90% male. So increased talent in the space 1000x, the ratio will naturally trend to more women in the space. It's not woke bullshit to recognise that imo and then ask what are current barriers.",
    "Well yeah sure, but that means you think it's reasonable that 90% of the relevant skills for crypto are male-owned, which is I think an incorrect assumption. It's not really woke culture bullshit to notice that talent is actively being -dissuaded- from working in a space.",

    "That is misrepresenting it. It's an ongoing token sale. An unlocking schedule suggests they're already locked and allocated to particular receivers, which they are not. It also misrepresents that they are purchased at a price decided by perpetual auction.",
    "You buy $looks with $ over time where the $ goes to the project stakeholders. The stakeholders are selling equity for $. What else would you call that?",
    "Yes. Users pay $ on trading fees and receive $looks. So, each day, there is a certain amount of $looks available to buy. The way you buy is by spending $ on fees to receive $looks. The $ on fees goes to $looks holders.",

    "Dunno why I'm replying to this brainlet take but will do so anyway: - In ETH's case, you do not exchange $ for something. You don't spend $ to get ETH. In ETH's case, you also have to do some work to earn your reward. - In LOOKS case, you spend $ and receive $looks.",
    "It ~is~ a perpetual ICO. They sell $looks in exchange for volume. The only difference is the WETH goes to -all- $looks holders, not just the team, which is a cool innovation on an ICO.",
    "Bro not totally sure what you're talking about anymore. Didn't claim at any point they shouldn't earn money, have said several times even in this thread that it was fairly theres. You seem pretty upset.",
    "I'm responding to the \"news\" that the team took WETH. I didn't do the thread before because nobody was freaking out that the team got any WETH lol...",
    "The airdrop was sent to OpenSea users, it would be impossible for me to _not_ have a position because I used OpenSea in the past. I didn't use LooksRare. Go back to the kids table.",
    "The thread is literally just how the public tokenomics enable that openly and how there is no \"foul play\" in them taking this WETH Would be a bit weird to start talking about their work ethic in the thread imo lol",
    "Well that would be a bit of a weird tweet thread wouldn't it? I'm commenting on the \"news\" that the team has cashed out 20k WETH via Tornado Cash. Why would I start talking about how hard the team is shipping lol It's pretty much irrelevant to the discussion",
    "pretty good anti-FUD but also good education for people on the practicalities of building and distributing community-owned projects.",
    "Would be good to see analysis of where each WETH earned in fees ended up in practice -- eg. % of airdrop staked, % of volume-earned staked, etc. Think this stuff is pretty interesting and will only see more of these community-owned designs, good analysis of user behaviour is",
    "Added to the thread. Got my numbers from tokenomics page, mental math on the rewards the team earned/cashed out and chatting to seed backers. Do you have a good breakdown of where the rewards have actually gone -- eg. what % stakers ocurred in each group?",
    "Additional info: Team &amp; treasury tokens are emitted gradually too, so initial supply is much more weighted to seed backers and airdrop.",
    "Not sure why you are upset that I have explained the tokenomics of a project that people were already discussing. I think extra info and clarification of incentives is not even fud tbh. Unless it's intentionally obfuscated but not really sure that is claimable here.",
    "The fud is \"looksrare took 20k WETH and tornado cashed it\". My thread says \"yes, that was fair, because they earned those WETH through these mechanisms that were made public at the beginning\". Actually think my thread is anti-fud.",
    "Bit ironic that you say \"people don't read\" when you did not read tweet number 2. I have literally never had a position in $looks except my airdrop coins, and I shorted it once on FTX. How did I \"participate\" in this ponzi?",
    "Again, to reiterate, this is not a fud thread, is actually a response to the fud threads re: team tornado cashing. This is just an explanation of the mechanics/incentive structures around the token that have been available to to read since day 1 lol",
    "No I am not an investor in Opensea lol",
    "BTW one thing I'd like to add is it appears there -is- a mechanism to stop the seed-stage backers (and possibly team) accruing the 18% $looks community staking rewards -- but that mechanism does not prevent the same tokens accruing the WETH fees.",
    "Would be ironic if I had misunderstood the docs after writing a 948498 tweet thread calling ppl illiterate for not reading them. Will say it's performance art or something.",
    "Final note: If you're mad about the $looks token design today, it's probably not because of the token design but instead because the price is down. You could've got mad about it a while ago if you read the docs. So I guess, you're mad at yourself for being illiterate. gm",
    "&amp; if I messed anything up or made any mistakes, pls let me know so I can correct :)",
    "Many ppl saying this is a fud thread. Not really lol, it's just a breakdown of the incentives in the system that were open for all to read in the docs. Wish more ppl would spend time understanding incentives behind token designs before getting outraged over the obvious.",
    "The fees obviously delivered a lot of ETH to the team, so they can build for a long time. And early backers are likely less incentivised to sell having already returned multiples on investments with staking rewards. Plus, attention is very valuable. Probably worth it for that.",
    "When you incentivise stuff with token emission, you're spending tokens to buy something. In this case, LooksRare bought volume (fees) and attention. But I don't know how \"sticky\" that volume is (how much of it remains after incentives end?).",
    "I don't really know if this model is \"good\" or \"bad\". It's certainly an innovative financial game. The airdrop is a great advert for the ponzi, anti-opensea is a popular narrative, and the incentivisation of volume with a \"tokens-for-volume ico\" that rewards stakers is smart.",
    "And obviously very lucrative for the team, and good for airdrop receivers as well. I know some people bought a lot of $looks and staked it, and shorted an equal amount on perps to earn the rewards delta-neutral. Also pretty good for them.",
    "If they invested 10 ETH, they've earned around 130 ETH in staking rewards. And they still hold their core position of $looks (probably worth more than 10 ETH right now, I don't know what the seed price of Looks was). Pretty good investment for seed backers.",
    "So for a while the team and early backers earn ~65% of the rewards from the \"initial volume offering\". What that looks like, roughly: A seed investor's investment has returned roughly 13x in ETH from their share of the staking - not including the $ appreciation of their $looks.",
    "As people buy the coins with fees/volume, these earned coins will dilute the staked supply of the early investors and the team. But at first, that's the distribution.",
    "This means the \"liquid\" and \"stakeable\" supply looks more like this: 9% stategic sale 28% team 28% treasury 34% airdrop (Btw anyone know if the strategic sale coins were stakeable? I know they were locked. Have assumed they were stakeable)",
    "But the community 75% is broken down like this: 12% - airdrop 19% - staking rewards 44% - volume rewards This means the early \"stakeable\" supply is very different to that infographic.",
    "Now, let's look at LooksRare. 75% community, with only 25% for insiders! Great right?",
    "So it's kind of like a perpetual ICO where the token buyers purchase with their fee spend, and the ETH from that fee spend goes to all token holders. In the fictional case of CobieSwap, that would be 66% me for the first few weeks at least.",
    "While people are wash-trading to earn their CobieSwap tokens, I am actually receiving 66% of their fees. Even tho the tokenomics could look like I'm earning only 20%. Eventually, if everyone claimed and staked their coins I would be earning 20%. But at first, this is impossible.",
    "But, these fees are paid to token holders! And the token holders are 80% community right?? Well, no. You have to stake your coins to get the fees. And the 70% to be farmed out can't be staked yet. So instead of owning 20% of the supply, I actually own 66% of the liquid supply.",
    "The 70% supply for future users will be distributed over 3 months based on volume/usage. People will probably wash trade their coins. Effectively, they'll spend some money in fees -- but be reimbursed with CobieSwap tokens. So they're kind of \"buying\" them with their fee spend.",
    "This looks great. 80% of the supply for community! No VCs! The airdrop is a good viral-growth mechanic, enough people will talk about this new project. And it has a good hook: we all hate Paraswap for their shitty airdrop, right? Just like we all hate Opensea..!",
    "Imagine I launch a product called CobieSwap. It's a fork of Paraswap. I'm keeping 20% of the tokens for myself. I'm airdropping 10% of the tokens to people that should have gotten a Paraswap airdrop before they fucked up the distribution. 70% of the tokens to future users.",
    "Before I start, disclosures so ain‚Äôt nobody getting upset: - Do not own any Looks - Did not buy the seed round - Not short looks either anymore so neutral/no position - Some friends did buy the seed round, you can tell cos they tweet about it 7 times per day",
    "Anyone surprised by this did not research the token properly at all. Was pretty obvious in the token incentives from day 1. Assumed everyone knew this was happening. It‚Äôs actually a pretty innovative ponzi model, kinda similar to a perpetual ICO but obfuscation layers on top.",

    "But funny that in non-gaming world, people said \"hey, owners should become more involved in operating, fuck the big bank/corp/whatever, we decide\" and in gaming they have an opposite reaction. I think at the end of the day, they have hard lives like everyone else does.",
    "And I can sympathise with that a lot. They've been lootboxxed and microtransacted to death already, and now they see that these multimillionaire bubble ponzis are going to be put in their game. Of course they think the worst, they hate the studio and the NFTs.",
    "So, if you think that, and you see the stupidity and exuberance in NFT markets (1m for a picture of an ugly monkey) then it makes sense that you'd conclude these shitbag companies are gonna fuck up the game by integrating the fucking stupidest speculative stuff ever.",
    "The main thing I took from it is that gamers really really don't trust the big studios. Like, the same way OG bitcoiners didnt trust paypal or the banks. They think they're capitalistic profiteering anti-player corps that mistreat employees and only care about PnL.",
    "It's unfortunate cos it means most conversations devolve into quote-tweet clout harvesting or just pure insults. Don't know if that's just an appeal-to-crowd to deflect technique or what.",
    "But most people don't even offer an opinion at all. They just state that you are an idiot, a scammer, dumb, clearly not a gamer, a grifter, whatever. The thing they do know is that they hate NFTs and anything pro-NFT must be dishonest and financially motivated.",
    "Some link to this, which obviously reads as an anti-NFT propaganda piece. Lots of inaccuracy or problems that are purely hypothetical.",

    "Yes, I said that in my tweet, 3rd order effects might be good for crypto markets generally but given that the markets are worth multiple trillions of dollars, there would only be minor upside, if any. Game studios would likely use some specific chain or new chain, eg. Ronin.",
    "I own some NFTs, yes, but those NFTs would obviously not have any financial benefit from a game studio creating their own NFTs. So I wouldn't benefit from it at all just because I own some NFTs.",

    "Hi Alexandra. 1. NFTs don't have to represent items, they can represent states or moments too. They _could_ exist outside of the game. 2. Of course not, but game rules could respect digital asset ownership too.",

    "I don't have an agenda, there would be 0 way for me to profit from games using NFTs, it's just an opinion on twitter. Maybe worth reflecting on why you got upset and hostile over it, ad homs are fun I guess. Cya!",

    "Well you didn't manage to stop yourself saying those things, you just put them into quotation marks, so you were just hostile to someone you don't know on the internet because you have a different opinion to them on NFTs, nice one :)",

    "Plus, even if ETH was staying proof of work, PoW creates a big financial incentive for cheap clean energy. CoinShares estimated that 74% of bitcoin mining is powered by renewables.",
    "So, while ETH has a high footprint right now, minting NFTs or moving them doesn't incrementally increase the footprint. And it moves to proof of stake in 6-8 months anyway so will use ~99.95% less energy.",
    "Beyond that, most NFT-chains and every single gaming blockchain uses proof of stake, not proof of work (mining). The only remaining NFT-popular chain that uses proof of work is Ethereum, which moves to proof of stake this year.",
    "Yes, I know how energy usage works. As you said, crypto energy usage scales with mining which is chain security. It does not scale with activity. So if people mint a lot of NFTs tomorrow, or zero NFTs, the amount of energy used is the same. It's not incremental.",

    "Most NFT projects are not stolen art ‚Äî content moderation on OpenSea is now very good. It‚Äôs not even clear what you think is a scam, you just shared a biased and easily refutable list of Reddit claims. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine.",

    "Hope that over time a more equitable model of game revenue that prioritises the things people enjoy becomes the status quo, but it's currently 8am and I am questioning why I spent all night talking to people that hate me because of my hobbies and interests. So, goodnight!!",
    "Out of all of the people that replied, only one person I spoke to was open-minded and thoughtful in their responses. Many were hostile w name-calling and languages around scams, pyramid schemes, eco-terrorism and stuff. Enjoyed the one conversation though.",
    "I think a more cooperative economic model is possible and ownership is a powerful motivator for players. Don't trust any of the omegacorps to do anything except milk their paypigs. Think new competitors may leverage cooperation and ownership to grow very quickly.",
    "Gamer twitter is not happy with me, seems a lot of them have stockholm syndrome and only imagine worst case scenarios from potential or implied change. The economic interests of the biggest studios are obviously extractive and misaligned with players",

    "I got my runescape account and my old LoL account hacked too, security practices are important regardless of what you're doing",
    "Thank you! You were the first person I spoke to that was coherent and open-minded and didn't call me a scammer or an eco-terrorist. Thanks for the chat. If you have an Ethereum address, I'll send you $10,000 to say cheers (have followed you so you can DM me).",
    "Because nfts enable more equitable incentives imo. Players becoming owners and new studios growing through cooperative models with their users create a diff dynamic to the capitalistic paypig current ripoff era.",
    "Even if they don't, it's extremely unlikely that any games are using Ethereum for NFTs anyway, so doesn't matter so much for NFT/game crossover",
    "You didn't necessarily pay for it just cos its an NFT. Items and skins are removed and changed all the time. At least if it was an NFT, you'd keep the provenance and history rather than it just being gone forever like Zz'Rot Portal is (rip).",
    "NFT owners still keep the item in their gallery/wallet -- they just cant use it when playing anymore. If everything is issued to the same chain, you could also end up with a gallery of all your game achievements from all games ever (by connecting the same wallet).",
    "Of course centralized companies can do whatever they want with the in-game rules. It's their game! They should optimise for fun of the players. If they wanna remove Skin 17 from Character B from the game because it creates unfair advantage, they should do it.",
    "Because issuing an NFT to a decentralized chain allows you to truly own the item, no matter what. If you're banned from the game, you keep your wallet. If the game servers die, you keep your wallet and item history. No central party can take your item away from you.",
    "Really hard thread to follow cos they kept replying to odd tweets instead of one long flow, but they were actually receptive and coherent unlike half of the other ppl just saying \"NFT bro\" and \"environment scammer\"",
    "Yes, the blockchain is \"decentralized\" -- this allows you to own the asset and it exist outside the game -- but the NFT issuer is just a verified issuer, and they can be a centralized company that has in-game rules for their NFTs.",
    "His point was about play-to-earn games which I agree are unsustainable models but analysis with bias-loaded language doesn't help. Let me know about any fair criticisms I've missed directly, happy to answer",
    "It's impossible to fake a mint as a verified author. If the original pokemon game had been built at a time of NFTs then certain actions could've been recorded on chain from an official Pokemon address, which is open and verifiable.",
    "In this tweet it is deduced most players \"lose money\". I just used the same terminology to show that it doesn't make that much sense.",
    "Exactly -- we agree! Most people are willing to spend on entertainment like cinema and games. That shouldn't be framed as \"losing money\" whether NFTs are in the game or not.",
    "I like to own stuff that had some importance to me -- like bookmarks through my life. The first ever Mew caught in the original games would be cool to own. The first person who did it gets paid, the company gets paid, and I get to be happy owning a cool part of history.",
    "Because playing the original pokemon games was important to me, I loved that time in my childhood, I was excited when my older cousin showed me the glitch to capture Mew, and I like collectibles. I buy old movie posters and movie props too.",
    "I actually 100% agree with you. Despite having a 'career' in crypto, I'm pretty anti current NFTs (see quote rt). But, important to see past short-term trends and hubris. If there are possibilities for the future that are better, shouldnt disregard them.",
    "They -were- solely used for the fun card game originally. They gained value because of how fun they were, they are historically important and have provenance. They were not -designed- to be pricey, though.",
    "If the first ever Mew minted on chain was available to purchase today, I'd probably buy it. But I think that's a very different example than \"playing to earn money\".",
    "eg. I imagine that the first ever Mew caught using the Missingno trick in Pokemon Blue/Red has some provenance and historic value. But at the time the user would've used wanted to keep the pokemon and other users would've wanted to get their own for free.",
    "I think you're expecting worst case scenarios. I admit it's easy to think of them, I can tell you 10,000 reasons why everything is a bad idea. But IMO the status quo is extractive and any ideas that can create more cooperative models are worth exploring.",
    "it was just a joke because everyone failed at the poll thing lol",
    "I think a more equitable economic model would be good for gamers and while I don't believe the existing capitalistic omegacorps will embrace anything that decreases their own profits, a cooperative economic model might create competitive growth/retention vectors for new studios",
    "True, but it means gamers _can_ earn them that way and the gamers that are willing to do that are the ones deciding scarcity, such that these items would be finite based on user achievements. So hard-to-achieve stuff might be more valuable, perhaps.",
    "Imagine a scenario where items are only earned through gameplay. Then (if they want to) users can sell them to other people that perhaps don't want to earn them through gameplay. The co takes a % creator royalty on each sale. You don't have to finagle or ever sell, but others can",
    "I think the planet stuff is mostly misinfo btw, NFT activity doesn't impact climate because electricity usage scales with chain security and not with chain activity (the block is mined anyway) plus none of the NFT-chains will use proof of work by the end of this year anyway",
    "Yes of course I have. You're anchoring to the ones that hit the news, they're expensive. But there's hundreds of thousands of NFTs that cost close to zero that you don't know about, they're just not popular or designed to be investments.",
    "to minimize. The only real energy-hog is proof of work, and as of the coming summer this year there will be no NFTs on proof of work chains (the last remaining NFT-popular chain moves to proof of stake which has virtually negligible impact). Supply chain/g-card mkt sucks tho yea.",
    "that a more equitable model is possible and if gamers choose such a model those omegacorps will be out-competed, especially since a more cooperative model also doubles as a tool for growth. RE: climate I think there is a lot of misinfo unfortunately, but do think it's important",
    "Markets of cosmetics already exist tho, NFTing stuff potentially allows companies a more cooperative economic model and to actually make less to earn the same (through creator royalties in ongoing economies). I also dont trust the big paypig-exploiting cos either, but do think",
    "I think that is potentially a reasonable argument. A counterargument would be: buying, playing, enjoying then leaving a game would still be possible. For most people, using it as entertainment only is fine, nothing has to change. Tertiary experience change at most.",
    "Ohhhhh I understand -- I saw his tweet because you retweeted it, so it automatically tags you, sorry!",
    "I cannot tell if you are being intentionally facetious or not lol NFTs in games doesn't mean you have to buy the NFTs -- you could acquire them free -- and chain usage does not have incremental environmental impact. Electricity usage scales w chain security not activity.",
    "I didn't tag you. I replied to your other tweets here, because you tweeted me directly. I didn't tag you since.",
    "Well, I think that NFT monetization can happen in many ways and yes of course anti-consumer capitalistic actors can exploit it as they do everything. But it may also enable some more co-operative economic models too which could create better experiences for gamers.",
    "Hey, I'm not going to convince you of anything and I don't really care how your life goes from here, but being open-minded about societal change and growth is usually +ev, every paradigm shift looked like a ponzi scheme at first.",
    "Hey, at least we both agree that a more equitable and co-operative economic model would be better than what currently exists for gamers. I think lots of people feel that way and since consumers dictate the market, over a long enough timeline, it might become reality.",
    "I am one of the most anti-NFT people in crypto and yet am able to be unbiased about what currently is and what could be.",
    "Being conned was intellectually stimulating, fun and profitable, I would do it again in a heartbeat.",
    "I am one of the most anti-NFT people in crypto, it might be worthwhile to turn down biases every now and then",
    "After all, consumer has the power to dictate market. And if the model is sustainable, it gives indie and small publishers tools to grow and retain users because the economic model is co-operative rather than extractive. And if they grow quickly, they can compete.",
    "If you think publishers are anti-user, which your first tweet seems to suggest, then finding a co-operative economic model seems beneficial for players. And I understand it's easy to find lots of flaws in ideas but I do think some of the ideas have merit or are at least exciting.",
    "Indeed, agree, I think it's a hard balance but doesn't mean it's entirely impossible and especially doesn't mean anyone trying is a scammer. Imo anyway.",
    "Agree with this. Think Alanah's points were pretty good but both would be ironed out by market forces over time, same way there's backlash against massive paywally DLC.",
    "No current game developer with large revenue and paypig audience will -- but future ones might, if it means that they grow more quickly, or retain more players, as a vector to help them compete.",
    "I think while that is potentially currently true, particularly speculators (less so bots/scammers), I don't think it ~has~ to be that way if systems are better designed in-context of a human experience rather than a frothy tech bubble driven by poor economic policy",
    "I think the environmental impact of proof of work is a super important debate. But the impact of NFTs in that debate is currently small (the block is mined anyway, the NFT doesnt change environmental impact) and within 6-9 months is zero since there will be no NFTs on POW chains.",
    "NFTs that exist on proof of stake chains have a much lower (virtually negligible) environmental impact. Most NFT-popular chains are proof of stake right now, and the last remaining proof of work chain is moving to proof of stake this year due to environmental concern.",
    "Environmental damage is done due to proof of work. NFTs that exist on proof of work chains do not have an incremental impact on the environment such that minting the NFT uses extra electricity. The chain itself has a carbon footprint that scales with security, not chain activity.",
    "Obviously for gaming this is much harder, because you can't copy-paste a game. But over a long enough timeline, these options may become available too. Think it's hubris to dismiss while also recognising that the current status quo is extractive and anti-player.",
    "things in a different way, users are attracted to a more cooperative and equitable economic model. In crypto users often have the choice between two virtually identical products (since open source, copypasta world) and they choose where they can share in ownership.",
    "as a method of growth and co-operation. They may be niche and enabled by crypto, but young web users know that the economic interests of the biggest internet platforms are concentrated and often poorly aligned with their most valuable contributors. So, if we can build",
    "Doesn't mean anything much outside they're a trendy collectible. Real world collectibles got out of hand at times too. It's a human thing. Anyway, my suggestion is grounded in some reality. Many new products now are giving their community gigantic ownership in their product",
    "I don't think that crime or exuberance really have much relevance here since a banana taped to the wall sold for millions of dollars and throughout history things, especially bad art, have been priced stupidly. Yeah, some apes cost $300k (not 70m) right now in a bubble.",
    "How are they \"extra\"? They might not even be transactions at all. When you collected the helmets in Halo 3 you were not \"buying\" or transacting.",
    "Why does the NFT have to cost thousands of dollars? Just because some existing ones do? You might not even need to pay for them in-game.",
    "Artificial scarcity already exists in games, though. If these mechanics ruin the games then the games will fail since nobody will enjoy them. As I said, easy to find flaws, I can list more than you have. But there are ideas that are exciting.",
    "Market will decide to play the fun games, markets are efficient",
    "games, then the market will dictate what is acceptable. I think people are tired of modern tech companies privately monetizing their attention to make a handful of billionaires. I am interested in at least intellectually exploring any idea that can change that social dynamic.",
    "Obviously it is easy to see downsides and point out possible flaws or how capitalist entities might exploit these things. But at the same time, I think there is excitement in the idea that there might be more sustainable and player-friendly models and if players _chose_ those",
    "It would also have sentimental value, if it was in my wallet today. \"I won this helmet, on this date\". I think allowing players to share in the upside of the success of the game, especially the most engaged players, is a pretty interesting idea that will allow smaller publishers",
    "(...) items unlocked for players that achieve certain things. I remember when I got the hayabusa helmet in Halo 3 doing that jumping through the hoops shit really early before everyone figured it out. It was fucking awesome. A great memory. That helmet would've had early value.",
    "If you want, you can sell it. They'll take a \"creator royalty\" of 10%, so they keep making revenue on future sales. High volume trading of these items would actually be a good business line for them, which means they can do cool stuff for players: like free (...)",
    "They're aware that video games have emotional connection, and items from old games you loved can have lasting value of some kind. Imagine that they build a game where, when they sell you an overpriced skin for a gun, you get to keep it forever -- even out of game.",
    "They're aware that modern games are social and participative; that they are places for friends to hang out together. They're aware that modern games are addictive patterns to sell you overpriced skins for private profits while you hang out with those friends.",

    "The SAFT itself is \"tradeable\" peer to peer through trust and/or legal enforcement. But since it requires another party willing to purchase a locked contract and you cannot take advantage of market liquidity, there is additional risk to the position and thus a discount.",
    "I dunno if you're being intentionally facetious but they are locked in that the coins cannot be moved until vesting dates. When you buy them, you are buying the SAFT. It is required that you trust the seller to send you the coins as they unlock. You cannot sell them on a CEX.",

    "well the SAFT seller has no risk because they get paid up front, so if theyre looking to get out they dont care who they sell to as long as the counterparty passes KYC and AML stuff my argument is with the proper research, anybody couldve bought the solana safts at a disount.",

    "Yes you can. There are OTC rooms with regular high turnover. You can just enquire. I don't tell people who I am when I contact them to buy until I've got a deal.",
    "That is not a \"seed discount\" ... the token was trading on market. They were buying locked coins from a previous funding round at a discount to market.",

    "Govs typically want some inflation in the economy. If you didn‚Äôt create new money, but more wealth is created, money gets more valuable over time (since wealth increases but $ supply fixed). If money increases in value, products decrease in price as their value didn‚Äôt change.",

    "The other thing I think is important is: do people systemise their shilling? One time can be a mistake, twice maybe unlucky, but recurring shilling with the same result becomes increasingly bad imo.",
    "Cos you were shilling something you are buying on the same terms as everyone else virtually ‚Äî so a paid promo looked like you were taking the same risk as everyone else, when you were not. Kind of like how shilling a presale now has diff risk for the shilled and the shillee.",
    "But going to 0 took a while. Slow and painful with hope along the way. Whereas now the markets are often down only and much less clear what peoples entry prices are. I think undisclosed paid promotion was probably more of a problem then than ‚Äúpresales‚Äù.",
    "Everyone being on similar/the same terms meant there were no weird fdv dynamics and most ICOs pumped pretty hard cos it was at least sort of transparent where entry prices were and etc. But eventually all these projects virtually went to 0 anyway.",
    "These fdv dynamics create the ‚Äúdown only‚Äù markets of todays presales because all participants minus the new market buyers are at large multiples. Whereas 2017 icos everyone was on similar-ish terms (though maybe presales were more prevalent than I thought from replies to above).",
    "Yeah was active but didn‚Äôt participate in many ICOs, was mainly trading liquid markets. Just saying what I remember ‚Äî V likely that I just didn‚Äôt participate in the right stuff. I thought presales evolved in mid to late 2017 but possible I just didn‚Äôt know before",
    "I said late 2017 ‚Äî I think they were introduced in 2017 after early ICOs and The DAO. But its very possible that I am wrong because I didn‚Äôt participate in many ICOs in 2017.",
    "I remember someone paying like 10k in tx fees to get into the ICO that Vinny did and thinking it was insane. Lol. Nowadays, presales have vesting and gigantic multiple discounts on public sale (if any). FDV dynamics with low float mean valuations are v high on early market.",
    "The main diff between now and 2017 is that 2017 presales were much rarer ‚Äî they evolved later in the cycle, and often had discounts of 20% or so. The ICO I shilled didn‚Äôt even have one, the early ICOs were kind of like how NFT drops happen today with gas wars to get in.",
    "My take is that either you think this stuff is acceptable or bad. Personally, I think transparently disclosed shilling is ok ‚Äî not good, but fine. Transparent disclosure requires knowledge of presales prices probably. And flips to bad if people are selling into their ‚Äúshills‚Äù.",
    "My take (also for clarity: haven‚Äôt shilled a presale but did shill one of the first 2017 ICOs that completely failed to deliver anything, and have also bought many presales or seed rounds and not tweeted about them ‚Äî not involved in the Zach stuff but did RT his Melker thread)",

    "I only gave money to people who lost their MSP or got hacked or whatever, and two followers I knew that had small accounts and told me they went all-in basically because of me. Wasn't a lot of money though",
    "Yeah of course, gotta rep your Ls as well as your Ws innit. MSP has come up on Up Only a couple of times (both  and  spoke about it as their biggest losses). Recently half-wrote a blog post about my biggest mistakes in crypto and this is def top 3.",
    "Anyway, good trip down memory lane for me. I started writing a blog post about my biggest mistakes in crypto a month or so ago, but I never finished it, and this might be a good motivator to finish. MSP was top 3.",
    "They did a refund earlier this year -- I can find the link if you still hold MSP tokens.",
    "Outside of an actual scam, I basically shilled the worst thing possible: early ICO (4m? raised, pre \"The DAO report\") that delivered virtually nothing but somehow did it very slowly. Ppl trolled me for shilling an ICO, so then when it went up I was even more euphoric. Lol. Idiot.",
    "I did a calculation when I got the refund for Mothership earlier this year on how different my NW would be if I bought BNB instead of MSP and it was pretty dirty. Haven't shilled anything since, even if I think it's legit, too many people/noobs get hurt if you're wrong.",
    "Insult to injury: the main CEX for MSP was Cryptopia, which got hacked/exploited and all funds stolen, then into a bankruptcy thing which hasn't even concluded yet. So all users of that got fucked too.",
    "I remember being so euphoric. My bags were pumping, early cycle, and I had found the actual 10,000x winner. I had found Binance before Binance existed! Only to have supported/shilled a total failure while ignoring the real 10000x winner that launched virtually at the same time.",
    "So I bought the wrong thing, shilled the wrong thing, and it virtually went to actual 0 while Binance went to infinity. They eventually refunded the token holders with the money they raised this year but it was basically like just holding cash since 2017 so also rekt.",
    "I got refunded using the refund process earlier this year -- if you still hold MSP you can get it too. It's shite but better than nothing.",
    "And the whole way through I kinda just expected them to make it work, and they never did. Fun note here: Binance's ICO was at the exact same time. And I bought 0 of it, instead went heavy MSP. History shows how that one went.",
    "It was also the last time I shilled anything too. Learned a lesson I didn't really need to learn hard on that. Obviously, the whole thing fucking died, team fucked off, they pivoted to something else. I think it was Cryptopathic's biggest ever single loss lol.",
    "To make things worse, I wasn't really big into \"shilling\" things. Did a lot of shilling in altcoin season in 2013-&gt;2016 but as followers grew I stopped. This probably actually made it worse, since a \"rare\" shill has more weight to it than one of 10 per week.",
    "I knew one of the founding engineers (had previously worked with him at a non-crypto startup and thought he was very good) so I knew it wasn't a \"scam\". (Unfortunately in crypto \"scam\" and \"failure\" are virtually exactly the same in impact). God, what could have been.",
    "Lol god, mothership. That was one of my biggest mistakes in crypto. I lost a lot of money and a bunch of credibility. I was so bullish because crypto exchanges were historically very trash and a tokenized exchange growing in-sync with ETH's token \"boom\" was clearly going to win.",

    "Ethereum (where most NFTs are) switches from 'proof of work' to 'proof of stake' within the next year which likely reduces energy usage by ~99% which is significantly more reasonable.",
    "Thus, if you treat CO2 emissions from Ethereum as constant, it's better if all $ revenue returned from blocks mined (including NFT sale proceeds) were used to plant trees, fund solar, provide clean cooking stoves, etc. Of course, it is also better if CO2 emissions are reduced.",
    "If you mint 10000 NFTs in a day, or 0 NFTs in a day, the CO2 emission from the Ethereum blockchain is identical as long as hash is constant. Bitcoin's climate impact is larger than Ethereum's, and Bitcoin has no NFTs Hashrate is correlated with market cap, not # of NFTs created",
    "These are false equivalents. If ~not minting the NFT~ vs ~minting the NFT~ made an incremental CO2 emission difference then sure, it would be the same, but whether or not you mint the NFT does not change the CO2 impact of the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "Of course it would be preferable if they learned the facts behind their fav hatred topic but even if they are unwilling or unable to do that, the objectively superior course of action for their interests remains diverting large $ from demand-side of NFTs to pro-eco initiatives.",

    "If the work goes to an artist that is not climate conscious it‚Äôs worse for the planet overall. If an eco-friendly artist accepts the work and uses some % of payment to make it carbon negative, then the net climate impact is better than if the work was rejected.",
    "That‚Äôs not the point. The point is that climate conscious artists can ensure that a payment from NFT $ can make the projects they work on carbon negative. The NFT series gets made anyway, the PoW blocks are mined anyway, why would you not want to ensure it‚Äôs reduced eco impact?",
    "Not understanding things doesn‚Äôt give you integrity.",
    "You have to think about it in what you can control. You cant prevent the NFT project being made but you can offset whatever damage you perceive to be done (plant trees, carbon offsetting) if you have the money to do so. If you reject the job, nobody does that. You can ensure it.",

    "IMO u have to think about the parts of the equation that you can impact. In this ex, you can change 1) who gets paid 2) the quality of the art &amp; 3) how the proceeds of the payment are spent. You can't change who gets the fees etc, that happens the same in all decision-forks.",
    "How? Nazi soldiers were not paid $1m per week and there was no viable way of using your wages to \"offset\" genocide.",

    "It seems like the best course of action for climate-conscious artists is to actually accept the crypto job offers and then offset the damage they think they are doing with part of their payment. This way they can personally ensure it is \"climate neutral\" while still getting paid.",
    "Good point we will now enter a bear market because a digital artist that disliked crypto still dislikes crypto",

    "Here is a fun way to think about it: The person that offered you a job is still going to make those NFTs except now it will just be a different artist. Your actions are therefore ultimately futile and climate-neutral. You didn't prevent climate damage, you just gave up $1m.",

    "Lots of VCs and angel investors are attracted to these dump-only projects because its a quick flip for more ETH. They dont create value, only create profits for insiders. Of course early backers of projects that create value will have large unrealised profits. See also: Uniswap",
    "IMO the majority of the focus should instead be on projects that: * do not do proper vesting terms (anything less than a year is a joke) * do not even launch a product * do not have well-performing secondary markets (down only) * do not meaningfully contribute anything",
    "Of course, you mightve picked a different competitor like Stkr or SharedStake or StakeHound and ended up rugged. Building projects is hard, and doing the right thing creates value. Lido initial round was $0.01 and the second round (w Paradigm etc) was $0.65ish I think.",
    "If you wanted to join the round at the time, all you had to do was ask. We had several people reach out and join the seed round. Or, you could've bought Rocket Pool (a competitor) which was trading at 0.30c at the time -- and topped at $30ish and their product didnt launch yet.",
    "The conclusion is simple though. If you build a legitimately valuable project, it will perform well in a bull market 50k into Lido seed in October is now ~$20m (not yet vested) 50k into Doge at the same time would now be ~$5m 50k into CryptoPunks then would now be ~$25m",
    "Yes, hence my tweet above that you have quoted, which is mocking bitboy for calling lido \"a scam\" referencing a thread that paints it as a good investment. Do you understand?",

    "No, Lido becomes more useful after ETH2 launches. Lido is not JUST a two-way door for staking. Lido‚Äôs core service is the ability to capture both the yield from staking rewards AND the yield from defi. It solves the adversarial incentives between on-chain lending vs staking.",

    "If this pool has a lot of liquidity it‚Äôs great for stakers, because they‚Äôre able to ‚Äúunstake‚Äù by selling their stETH for ETH pretty close to 1:1. It‚Äôs a bad user experience if you stake, need to unstake, but 1 stETH is only worth 0.85 ETH. So having a liquid pool is important.",
    "Lido tries to solve this by allowing stETH to be tradeable. You can sell your stETH back for ETH, a sort of ‚Äúfaux unstaking‚Äù. Lido and Curve both co-incentivise a Curve pool of eth/stETH liquidity. Basically, rewarding people with LDO and CRV for providing liquidity to this pool",
    "This stETH token rebases daily so as your ETH earns staking rewards, your stETH balance increases. You can do whatever you want with the stETH, it‚Äôs an ERC20 token that represents a claim on the underlying ETH. ETH staking is a one-way door currently. You stake, no unstaking.",
    "JK. Disclaimer: I cofounded lido and am ex-incubating core team. No longer work on any of lido‚Äôs core teams When u stake with Lido, Lido sends your ETH to be staked with one of Lido‚Äôs approved validators. It then gives you a stETH token in return which represents your staked ETH",

    "which one, the one where i give them an idea that protects 1000s of eth bought by everyone in the sale -- or the one where i want to list everything for sale because they were going to spend funds on paying for \"influencer waifus\" rather than addressing sale issues? lmao",
